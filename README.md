# Assignment 2

You will use this exact `Makefile` for your Homework 2. Failure to do so will result in *deduction* of points. Replace this file with a `README.md` for your own project. You can move these instructions to the bottom of the file if you wish.

To compile on terminal, type:

```bash
make
```

You can compile one program individually by just typing `make <Program Name>`, for example:

```bash
make query_tree
```

To delete executables and object files, type:

```bash
make clean
```

For this assignment the files test_tree_mod, sequence_map.h, and avl_tree_mod.h were created. The files test_tree, query_tree, avl_tree, bst_tree were modified to account for missing functions. Some errors that occured were incorrect parsing of the database file which lead to a missing sequence. The input files are sequences.txt and rebase.210.txt
